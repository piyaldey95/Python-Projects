Bitcoin, the most popular decentralized cryptocurrency, greatly influencing the global economic landscape since its inception in 2008. The cryptocurrency, known for its dynamic transparency and independence from intermediaries, gets driven by its volatility and market sentiment. This study explores to unravel the influence of sentiment indicators derived from Twitter, Google Trends, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) on Bitcoin price movements using deep learning models. Specifically, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Financial Domain Specific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (FinBERT) are implemented to extract sentiment scores and labels, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is implemented for price direction prediction. LSTM on BERT and LSTM on FinBERT achieved an overall accuracy of 0.85 and 0.86, respectively, for next day price movement prediction whereas, for next month predictions, the accuracy reached up to 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The study identified significant influence of sentiment features on weekly and monthly price movement prediction. However, no added advantage of using FinBERT over BERT for extracting twitter sentiment was observed.
